go-crypto
=========

Learning cryptography using Go. I am trying to learn cryptography -- the math,
the security and the programming aspects -- using Go language. Coincidentally
I also want to learn the Go language. Nice dovetailing huh!

These pieces of code are probably insecure and wrong. So use it only as a
starting point. I will make corrections based on my learning and based on
feedback.

How to run: Just go into a numbered directory and do `go run src.go`.

- [1](1): Create a public-private keypair.
- [2](2): Create a public-private keypair, and create a self-signed certificate
using that keypair.
